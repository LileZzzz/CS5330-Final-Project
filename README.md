CS5330 Computer Vision Final Project

# Satellite Image Classification System

A deep learning system for classifying land use and land cover from satellite images using Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

## Features

- **FastAPI backend** for model inference
- **Streamlit web interface** for easy interaction
- **Pre-trained ViT model** fine-tuned on EuroSAT dataset
- Supports classification of 10 land cover classes:
  - Annual Crop 🌾
  - Forest 🌲
  - Herbaceous Vegetation 🌿
  - Highway 🛣️
  - Industrial 🏭
  - Pasture 🐄
  - Permanent Crop 🍇
  - Residential 🏘️
